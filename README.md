## Gap assessment ##

### Synopsis ###
Assess the number of gaps generated when the following parameters are varied:
* number of samples
* coverage value to consider relative to the mean (+/- SD)
* effect of using the median instead of the mean
* coverage threshold (e.g. 20x)

### Usage ###

*Find Gaps*
Takes as parameters:
- coverage files (e.g. x.cov.gz or x.exome.gz)
- threshold coverage e.g. 20x
- minimum gap size

*Find gap at position*

### Suggested graphs ###

* Stability vs number of samples
* Histogram of gap lengths
* % bases affected vs threshold
* number of gaps vs threshold
* % bases affected vs SD
* number of gaps vs SD
